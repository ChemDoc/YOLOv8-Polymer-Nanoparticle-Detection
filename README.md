# YOLOv8-Polymer-Nanoparticle-Detection
This project applies YOLOv8 for the detection and morphological analysis of polymer nanoparticles observed via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The goal is to classify different nanostructures and measure their dimensions based on a scale bar for accurate size conversion.
